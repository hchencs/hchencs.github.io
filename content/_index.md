- AI-driven security: [DSN 2024](/publications/#lin2024IDS)
- Software security: [CCS 2024](/publications/#lyu2024PromptFuzz) [CCS 2023](/publications/#chen2023Hopper) [ACL 2023](/publications/#zhao2023)

Open positions for graduate students, postdoctoral reseachers, and research scientists are available.
