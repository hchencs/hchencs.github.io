My research focuses on computer security. I am interested in a broad range of security problems, currently focusing on
- AI security: NeurIPS 2023 ([1](/publications/#li2023Attack) [2](/publications/#li2023ILPD)) ICLR 2023 ([1](/publications/#li2023Squeeze) [2](/publications/#li2023Bayesian))
- AI-driven security: [DNS 2024](/publications/#lin2024IDS)
- Software security: [CCS 2024](/publications/#lyu2024PromptFuzz) [CCS 2023](/publications/#chen2023Hopper) [ACL 2023](/publications/#zhao2023)
